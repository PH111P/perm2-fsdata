fsdata
===

Various helper scripts that compile the data files in FSROOT/DATA.

To compile the data, run `make LOCAL=1`; this compiles the various configuration and data files in the `data` folder and produces an `out` folder with the compiled data files. This also creates header files containing names of generated items, locations, pkmn, etc.
